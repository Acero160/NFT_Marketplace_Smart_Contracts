# Dubai Marketplace Smart Contracts ðŸš€



This repository contains a set of smart contracts designed to facilitate the creation and trading of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) within a decentralized marketplace. The system allows users to mint, buy, and trade NFTs using Ethereum-based ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards, providing a seamless experience for both token management and NFT transactions.


## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **DubaiERC1155**: A mintable multi-token standard (ERC1155) for creating and managing multiple types of tokens.
- **DubaiERC20**: A basic ERC-20 token to manage fungible tokens within the marketplace.
- **DubaiNFT**: An ERC-721 contract to mint unique, tradable NFTs representing digital assets.
- **Marketplace**: A decentralized marketplace for buying and selling NFTs. It enables users to purchase NFTs with Ether, while also rewarding them with Dubai ERC-20 tokens.

### Core Functionality

- **Minting NFTs**: NFTs are created and stored in the marketplace, allowing users to purchase them.
- **Buying NFTs**: Users can purchase NFTs by sending Ether to the marketplace contract. Upon a successful transaction, users receive a specified reward in ERC-20 tokens.
- **Token Rewards**: For every NFT purchase, users are rewarded with Dubai ERC-20 tokens.
- **Flexible Pricing**: The price of NFTs and the reward tokens can be adjusted by the owner of the contract.

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations
- The contracts include basic security checks to prevent invalid token minting.
- Only registered users can buy lottery tickets, ensuring fair participation.
- Funds are securely stored in the smart contract until distribution.
- Transactions are completed only if users have sufficient funds.

--- 

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
- Implementing additional token standards like ERC-1155 for batch ticketing.
- Integrating a frontend for a seamless user experience.
- Adding advanced lottery features such as bidding, auctions, or staking.
